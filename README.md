## Basic Concepts

**Agents** 
Agents are autonomous entities designed to perform specific roles and achieve goals based on the tasks assigned to them. They are like super-powered LLMs that can execute tasks in a loop until they arrive at the final answer.

**Tasks**
Tasks define the specific actions each agent must take, their expected outputs, and mark critical outputs as deliverables if they are the final products.

**Team**
The Team coordinates the agents and their tasks. It starts with an initial input and manages the flow of information between tasks.

  <summary><b style="color:black;">The Kaiban Board</b></summary>

Kanban boards are excellent tools for showcasing team workflows in real time, providing a clear and interactive snapshot of each member's progress. 

>We’ve adapted this concept for AI agents. 

Now, you can visualize the workflow of your AI agents as team members, with tasks moving from "To Do" to "Done" right before your eyes. This visual representation simplifies understanding and managing complex AI operations, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere.
</details> 

<details style="margin-bottom:10px;">
  <summary><b style="color:black;">Role-Based Agent Design</b></summary>

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
Harness the power of specialization by configuring AI agents to excel in distinct, critical functions within your projects. This approach enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of each task, moving beyond the limitations of generic AI.

In this example, our software development team is powered by three specialized AI agents: Dave, Ella, and Quinn. Each agent is expertly tailored to its specific role, ensuring efficient task handling and synergy that accelerates the development cycle.
</p>

```js
import { Agent } from 'kaibanjs';

const daveLoper = new Agent({
  name: 'Dave Loper',
  role: 'Developer',
  goal: 'Write and review code',
  background: 'Experienced in JavaScript, React, and Node.js'
});

const ella = new Agent({
  name: 'Ella',
  role: 'Product Manager',
  goal: 'Define product vision and manage roadmap',
  background: 'Skilled in market analysis and product strategy'
});

const quinn = new Agent({
  name: 'Quinn',
  role: 'QA Specialist',
  goal: 'Ensure quality and consistency',
  background: 'Expert in testing, automation, and bug tracking'
});

```
</details>


<details style="margin-bottom:10px;">
  <summary><b style="color:black;">Tool Integration</b></summary>

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
Just as professionals use specific tools to excel in their tasks, enable your AI agents to utilize tools like search engines, calculators, and more to perform specialized tasks with greater precision and efficiency.

In this example, one of the AI agents, Peter Atlas, leverages the Tavily Search Results tool to enhance his ability to select the best cities for travel. This tool allows Peter to analyze travel data considering weather, prices, and seasonality, ensuring the most suitable recommendations.
</p>

```js
import { Agent, Tool } from 'kaibanjs';

const tavilySearchResults = new Tool({
  name: 'Tavily Search Results',
  maxResults: 1,
  apiKey: 'ENV_TRAVILY_API_KEY',
});

const peterAtlas = new Agent({
  name: 'Peter Atlas',
  role: 'City Selector',
  goal: 'Choose the best city based on comprehensive travel data',
  background: 'Experienced in geographical data analysis and travel trends',
  tools: [tavilySearchResults]
});
```

  const { agents, workflowResult } = useTeamStore(state => ({
    agents: state.agents,
    workflowResult: state.workflowResult,
  }));

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={myAgentsTeam.start}>Start Team Workflow</button>
      <p>Workflow Result: {workflowResult}</p>
      <div>
        <h2>🕵️‍♂️ Agents</h2>
        {agents.map(agent => (
          <p key={agent.id}>{agent.name} - {agent.role} - Status: ({agent.status})</p>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default KaibanJSComponent;
```

const useStore = myAgentsTeam.useStore();

useStore.subscribe(state => state.workflowLogs, (newLogs, previousLogs) => {
    if (newLogs.length > previousLogs.length) {
        const { task, agent, metadata } = newLogs[newLogs.length - 1];
        if (newLogs[newLogs.length - 1].logType === 'TaskStatusUpdate') {
            switch (task.status) {
                case TASK_STATUS_enum.DONE:
                    console.log('Task Completed', {
                        taskDescription: task.description,
                        agentName: agent.name,
                        agentModel: agent.llmConfig.model,
                        duration: metadata.duration,
                        llmUsageMetrics: metadata.llmUsageMetrics,
                        costDetails: metadata.costDetails,
                    });
                    break;
                case TASK_STATUS_enum.DOING:
                case TASK_STATUS_enum.BLOCKED:
                case TASK_STATUS_enum.REVISE:
                case TASK_STATUS_enum.TODO:
                    console.log('Task Status Update', {
                        taskDescription: task.description,
                        taskStatus: task.status,
                        agentName: agent.name
                    });
