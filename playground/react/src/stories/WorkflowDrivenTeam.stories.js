# Workflow-Driven Teams

These teams demonstrate the new WorkflowDrivenAgent capabilities in KaibanJS. 
The WorkflowDrivenAgent executes predefined workflows instead of using LLM-based reasoning,
providing deterministic, structured execution with support for:

- **Sequential Processing**: Linear workflow execution
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent step execution
- **Conditional Logic**: Branching based on conditions
- **ForEach Operations**: Processing multiple items
- **Suspension/Resumption**: Pausing workflows for manual intervention

## Key Features

- **Deterministic Execution**: Workflows execute the same way every time
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with Zod schema validation
- **State Management**: Built-in workflow state tracking
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery
- **Team Integration**: Seamless integration with existing team system

## Basic Mathematical Workflow

This example demonstrates a simple sequential workflow that:
1. Adds two numbers
2. Multiplies the result by the original inputs
3. Formats the final result with calculation details

**Workflow Steps:**
- \`add\`: Adds input numbers a + b
- \`multiply\`: Multiplies sum by a * b  
- \`format\`: Creates formatted output with calculation details

**Input:** { a: 5, b: 3 }
**Expected Output:** Mathematical result with calculation breakdown

## Complex Workflow with Multiple Patterns

This example demonstrates advanced workflow patterns including:
1. Sequential processing (add â†’ multiply)
2. Conditional branching (even/odd logic)
3. Parallel processing (foreach with concurrency)
4. Result aggregation

**Workflow Steps:**
- \`add\`: Adds input numbers
- \`multiply\`: Multiplies result by inputs
- \`branch\`: Conditional logic for even/odd processing
- \`foreach\`: Parallel processing of items
- \`final\`: Aggregates all results

**Input:** { a: 4, b: 5 }
**Expected Output:** Complex result with sequential, conditional, and parallel processing results

// Suspension workflow demonstration

## Workflow with Suspension/Resumption

This example demonstrates workflow suspension capabilities:
1. Data validation
2. Manual approval step (suspends workflow)
3. Data processing (only after approval)
4. Final result aggregation

**Workflow Steps:**
- \`validate\`: Validates input data
- \`approval\`: Suspends for manual approval
- \`process\`: Processes approved data
- \`final\`: Aggregates workflow results

**Key Features:**
- **Suspension**: Workflow pauses for manual intervention
- **Resumption**: Can resume with approval decision
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of rejection

**Input:** { data: 'Sample data for approval workflow' }
**Expected Output:** Workflow result after validation and approval process

// Mixed team demonstration

## Mixed Workflow-LLM Team

This example demonstrates how workflow-driven agents can work alongside traditional LLM agents:
1. Workflow-driven data processing (validation and formatting)
2. LLM-based content analysis
3. LLM-based summary generation

**Team Composition:**
- **Data Processor**: WorkflowDrivenAgent for structured data processing
- **Content Analyzer**: ReactChampionAgent for intelligent content analysis
- **Summary Generator**: ReactChampionAgent for summary creation

**Workflow Steps:**
- \`validate-data\`: Validates and counts text
- \`format-data\`: Formats text and adds metadata

**Key Benefits:**
- **Deterministic Processing**: Structured data handling via workflows
- **Intelligent Analysis**: LLM-powered insights and analysis
- **Best of Both Worlds**: Combines reliability of workflows with creativity of LLMs

**Input:** Sample text for analysis
**Expected Output:** Processed data, analysis insights, and summary
