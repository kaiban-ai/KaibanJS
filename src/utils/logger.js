/**
 * Logging Utility.
 *
 * This file sets up and configures the logging system used across the KaibanJS library. It allows for setting log levels 
 * dynamically and provides a centralized logger that can be imported and used throughout the library.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Import this logger to add logging capabilities to any part of the application, facilitating debugging and tracking of 
 * application flow and state changes.
