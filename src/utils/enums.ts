/**
 * Enumeration Definitions.
 *
 * This file defines various enumerations used throughout the AgenticJS library, such as agent statuses, task statuses,
 * and workflow states. These enums provide a standardized set of constants that facilitate clear and consistent state management
 * and behavior handling across different components of the library.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Reference these enums to ensure consistent state management and behavior checks across the library's various functional areas.
 */

/** --- Agent Status Definitions ---
 *
 * INITIAL: The agent is set up and waiting to start the task.
 *
 * THINKING: The agent is strategizing and planning the approach based on the initial input.
 *
 * THOUGHT: The agent has formed a plan and is ready to act. This involves deciding on specific actions based on the reasoning.
 *
 * EXECUTING_ACTION: The agent is actively performing the actions determined in the thought phase.
 *
 * USING_TOOL: The agent is interacting with external tools to gather or verify information necessary for completing the task.
 *
 * OBSERVATION: The agent analyzes the results from the tools to update its understanding and plan.
 *
 * FINAL_ANSWER: The agent concludes the task with a final decision based on all collected and processed information.
 *
 * IDLE: The agent is idle, waiting for new instructions or tasks.
