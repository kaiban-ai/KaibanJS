/**
 * Enumeration Definitions.
 *
 * This file defines various enumerations used throughout the KaibanJS library, such as agent statuses, task statuses,
 * and workflow states. These enums provide a standardized set of constants that facilitate clear and consistent state management
 * and behavior handling across different components of the library.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Reference these enums to ensure consistent state management and behavior checks across the library's various functional areas.

//──── Agent Status Definitions ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// INITIAL: The agent is set up and waiting to start the task.
// THINKING: The agent is strategizing and planning the approach based on the initial input.
// THOUGHT: The agent has formed a plan and is ready to act. This involves deciding on specific actions based on the reasoning.
// EXECUTING_ACTION: The agent is actively performing the actions determined in the thought phase.
// USING_TOOL: The agent is interacting with external tools to gather or verify information necessary for completing the task.
// OBSERVATION: The agent analyzes the results from the tools to update its understanding and plan.
// FINAL_ANSWER: The agent concludes the task with a final decision based on all collected and processed information.
// IDLE: The agent is idle, waiting for new instructions or tasks.
// ABORTED: The agent has been aborted due to an error or external interruption.
// PAUSED: The agent has been paused due to an external interruption.

//
// INITIAL: The very beginning of the workflow process, before any action has been initiated.
// RUNNING: The workflow is actively processing tasks, indicating that the workflow is in full operation.

// RESUMED: The workflow is resumed, which could be due to task completion, a manual stop command, or other reasons.
// STOPPING: The workflow is in the process of being stopped, which could be due to task completion, a manual stop command, or other reasons.
// STOPPED: The workflow has been completely stopped and is in a stable state, ready for review or restart.
// ERRORED: The workflow has encountered a critical issue and has halted unexpectedly, requiring error handling or intervention.
// FINISHED: The workflow has successfully completed all its tasks and no further operational actions are required.
// BLOCKED: The workflow is unable to proceed due to one or more tasks being blocked, requiring administrative review or automated recovery actions to resume or terminate the blocked tasks.
