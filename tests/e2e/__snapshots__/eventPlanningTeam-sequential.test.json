Rationale for this chosen date is that it falls after major spring holidays, ensuring key stakeholders are likely to be available and it does not conflict with major local events in the venue area. Notes on potential conflicts or considerations include that this date may coincide with wedding season, which could impact venue availability and some stakeholders' schedules, so early confirmation and backup options should be prepared.\n\nTask: Contact the venue, confirms availability for the selected date, and handles booking formalities\nResult: Venue name: To Be Determined (TBD) - Need to contact venues directly for final decision.\nVenue address: TBD - Based on selected venue after confirming availability.\nConfirmation details: Availability for June 15, 2024, needs to be confirmed with the potential venues.\nCost estimate: TBD - Depends on selected venue once contacted and negotiated.\nNotes on policies or special arrangements: June 15 coincides with wedding season, early confirmation of venue is vital to secure the booking. Backup options should be looked into.\n\nTask: Compile a guest list by integrating RSVPs, VIP requests, and corporate contacts\nResult: The final answer cannot be provided at this moment due to the lack of specific data on current RSVPs, VIP requests, and corporate contacts. As per the existing plan for the event on June 15, 2024, the next steps would involve reaching out to the event planning team for guest details and checking the event management system to compile a complete guest list with the number of confirmed guests, contact details, and any special dietary or accessibility requirements.\n\nTask: Based on the guest list, create a menu and select a vendor to meet dietary preferences and budget constraints.\nResult: {\"menu\":{\"appetizers\":[\"Roasted Vegetable Platter (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\",\"Hummus with Vegetable Crudités (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\",\"Stuffed Mushroom Caps with Quinoa (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\"],\"main_courses\":[\"Lentil Stew (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\",\"Quinoa Salad with Mixed Greens (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\",\"Grilled Chicken with Seasonal Vegetables\"],\"desserts\":[\"Fruit Salad (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\",\"Chocolate Mousse (Dairy-Free, Vegan option available)\",\"Gluten-Free Brownies\"]},\"vendor\":{\"name\":\"Mai Oui Catering and Event Planning\",\"contractDetails\":\"Mai Oui Catering specializes in custom menus that cater to diverse dietary needs.

Rationale for this chosen date is that it falls after major spring holidays, ensuring key stakeholders are likely to be available and it does not conflict with major local events in the venue area. Notes on potential conflicts or considerations include that this date may coincide with wedding season, which could impact venue availability and some stakeholders' schedules, so early confirmation and backup options should be prepared.\n\nTask: Contact the venue, confirms availability for the selected date, and handles booking formalities\nResult: Venue name: To Be Determined (TBD) - Need to contact venues directly for final decision.\nVenue address: TBD - Based on selected venue after confirming availability.\nConfirmation details: Availability for June 15, 2024, needs to be confirmed with the potential venues.\nCost estimate: TBD - Depends on selected venue once contacted and negotiated.\nNotes on policies or special arrangements: June 15 coincides with wedding season, early confirmation of venue is vital to secure the booking. Backup options should be looked into.\n\nTask: Compile a guest list by integrating RSVPs, VIP requests, and corporate contacts\nResult: The final answer cannot be provided at this moment due to the lack of specific data on current RSVPs, VIP requests, and corporate contacts. As per the existing plan for the event on June 15, 2024, the next steps would involve reaching out to the event planning team for guest details and checking the event management system to compile a complete guest list with the number of confirmed guests, contact details, and any special dietary or accessibility requirements.\n\nTask: Based on the guest list, create a menu and select a vendor to meet dietary preferences and budget constraints.\nResult: {\"menu\":{\"appetizers\":[\"Roasted Vegetable Platter (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\",\"Hummus with Vegetable Crudités (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\",\"Stuffed Mushroom Caps with Quinoa (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\"],\"main_courses\":[\"Lentil Stew (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\",\"Quinoa Salad with Mixed Greens (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\",\"Grilled Chicken with Seasonal Vegetables\"],\"desserts\":[\"Fruit Salad (Vegan, Gluten-Free)\",\"Chocolate Mousse (Dairy-Free, Vegan option available)\",\"Gluten-Free Brownies\"]},\"vendor\":{\"name\":\"Mai Oui Catering and Event Planning\",\"contractDetails\":\"Mai Oui Catering specializes in custom menus that cater to diverse dietary needs.

Notes on potential conflicts or considerations include that this date may coincide with wedding season, which could impact venue availability and some stakeholders' schedules, so early confirmation and backup options should be prepared.\n\nTask: Compile a guest list by integrating RSVPs, VIP requests, and corporate contacts\nResult: The final answer cannot be provided at this moment due to the lack of specific data on current RSVPs, VIP requests, and corporate contacts.

Notes on potential conflicts or considerations include that this date may coincide with wedding season, which could impact venue availability and some stakeholders' schedules, so early confirmation and backup options should be prepared.\n\nTask: Compile a guest list by integrating RSVPs, VIP requests, and corporate contacts\nResult: The final answer cannot be provided at this moment due to the lack of specific data on current RSVPs, VIP requests, and corporate contacts. As per the existing plan for the event on June 15, 2024, the next steps would involve reaching out to the event planning team for guest details and checking the event management system to compile a complete guest list with the number of confirmed guests, contact details, and any special dietary or accessibility requirements.\n\""
