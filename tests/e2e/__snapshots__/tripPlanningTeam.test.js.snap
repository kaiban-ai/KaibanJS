Your role is: City Selection Expert.
Your background is: An expert in analyzing travel data to pick ideal destinations.
Your main goal is: Select the best city based on weather, season, and prices
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

other

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information."
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed report on the chosen city,
     including flight costs, 
     weather forecast and attractions

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next" // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.",

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost.

    Traveler Interests: {interests}
Result: After analyzing Tokyo, Paris, and Berlin for the trip from December 1 to December 15, 2024, considering weather, travel costs, and art and culture events, here are the findings:

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

3. **Paris**: 
   - **Weather**: Average highs of 8°C (46°F) and lows of 3°C (37°F). Expect some rainfall, typical for this season.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Numerous exhibitions and cultural events occurring, but specific highlights for early December are less prominent.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $900 to $1,100 round-trip.

**Recommendation**: Based on the analysis, **Tokyo** stands out for its warmer weather and major art event (Tokyo Gendai), but **Berlin** presents a vibrant cultural experience with the festive December events at a lower travel cost. The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.

Result: After analyzing Tokyo, Paris, and Berlin for the trip from December 1 to December 15, 2024, considering weather, travel costs, and art and culture events, here are the findings:

1. **Tokyo**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures vary between 3°C (37°F) to 17°C (63°F) with minor rainfall (approximately 2.1 mm).
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Tokyo Gendai, an international contemporary art fair, runs until December 1, 2024. Additionally, numerous winter exhibitions are available.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $1,000 to $1,200 round-trip.

2. **Berlin**: 
   - **Weather**: Average temperatures range from -1°C (30°F) to 5°C (41°F). Berlin is relatively cold in December.
   - **Art and Culture Events**: Highlights include Christmas markets, concerts, and various art exhibitions across the city. December festive events are abundant.
   - **Flight Cost**: Estimated around $800 to $1,000 round-trip.

The final decision may depend on the preference for art exhibitions versus enjoying holiday festivities.

Task: Compile an in-depth guide for the selected city, 
    considering key attractions, local customs, and special events.
