Result: Argentina won the Copa America 2024, defeating Colombia 1-0 in a dramatic final held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. The key moment came in the 88th minute when Lautaro Martínez scored the winning goal from a rebound during a corner kick. The match was delayed by over an hour due to overcrowding issues. Lionel Messi suffered an injury during the game but still celebrated his team's record 16th Copa America title. Colombia had a late penalty appeal denied by VAR, which confirmed Argentina's victory. This marked Argentina's successful defense of their Copa America crown, with goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez playing a crucial role in keeping a clean sheet. The tournament saw Argentina emerge as champions despite not being absolute favorites entering the final.

In a thrilling conclusion to the 2024 Copa America, Argentina emerged victorious, defeating Colombia 1-0 in a match filled with tension, drama, and late-game heroics. The final, held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, was delayed by over an hour due to overcrowding issues, adding to the anticipation and intensity of the encounter. Lionel Messi, despite suffering an injury during the game, celebrated his team's record 16th Copa America title, cementing Argentina's dominance in South American football.

The decisive moment came in the 88th minute when Lautaro Martínez capitalized on a rebound from a corner kick, slotting home the winning goal. The strike sent Argentine fans into raptures and left Colombia heartbroken. Colombia had a late penalty appeal denied by VAR, a decision that confirmed Argentina's victory and sparked debates among fans and pundits alike. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez played a pivotal role, keeping a clean sheet and making crucial saves to ensure his team's triumph.

Argentina's victory marked a successful defense of their Copa America crown, a testament to their resilience and tactical prowess under pressure. Entering the final, they were not the absolute favorites, but their ability to grind out results when it mattered most proved decisive. The team's collective effort, combined with individual brilliance from players like Lautaro Martínez and Emiliano Martínez, underscored their status as one of the continent's top sides.

As the final whistle blew, the Argentine squad erupted in celebration, with Messi, despite his injury, joining his teammates in lifting the trophy. The win not only solidified Argentina's legacy in the tournament but also set the stage for future challenges, including the 2026 World Cup. For Colombia, the narrow defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, but their performance throughout the tournament earned them respect and admiration. The 2024 Copa America will be remembered for its drama, passion, and the indomitable spirit of the champions, Argentina.",

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","description":"Search query to look up"},"includeDomains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"A list of domains to restrict search results to.\\n\\nUse this parameter when:\\n1. The user explicitly requests information from specific websites (e.g., \\"Find climate data from nasa.gov\\")\\n2. The user mentions an organization or company without specifying the domain (e.g., \\"Find information about iPhones from Apple\\")\\n\\nIn both cases, you should determine the appropriate domains (e.g., [\\"nasa.gov\\"] or [\\"apple.com\\"]) and set this parameter.\\n\\nResults will ONLY come from the specified domains - no other sources will be included.\\nDefault is None (no domain restriction)."},"excludeDomains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"A list of domains to exclude from search results.\\n\\nUse this parameter when:\\n1. The user explicitly requests to avoid certain websites (e.g., \\"Find information about climate change but not from twitter.com\\")\\n2. The user mentions not wanting results from specific organizations without naming the domain (e.g., \\"Find phone reviews but nothing from Apple\\")\\n\\nIn both cases, you should determine the appropriate domains to exclude (e.g., [\\"twitter.com\\"] or [\\"apple.com\\"]) and set this parameter.\\n\\nResults will filter out all content from the specified domains.\\nDefault is None (no domain exclusion)."},"searchDepth":{"type":"string","enum":["basic","advanced"],"description":"Controls search thoroughness and result comprehensiveness.\\n\\nUse \\"basic\\" for simple queries requiring quick, straightforward answers.\\n\\nUse \\"advanced\\" (default) for complex queries, specialized topics, \\nrare information, or when in-depth analysis is needed."},"includeImages":{"type":"boolean","description":"Determines if the search returns relevant images along with text results.\\n\\nSet to True when the user explicitly requests visuals or when images would \\nsignificantly enhance understanding (e.g., \\"Show me what black holes look like,\\" \\n\\"Find pictures of Renaissance art\\").\\n\\nLeave as False (default) for most informational queries where text is sufficient."},"timeRange":{"type":"string","enum":["day","week","month","year"],"description":"Limits results to content published within a specific timeframe.\\n\\nONLY set this when the user explicitly mentions a time period \\n(e.g., \\"latest AI news,\\" \\"articles from last week\\").\\n\\nFor less popular or niche topics, use broader time ranges \\n(\\"month\\" or \\"year\\") to ensure sufficient relevant results.\\n\\nOptions: \\"day\\" (24h), \\"week\\" (7d), \\"month\\" (30d), \\"year\\" (365d).\\n\\nDefault is None."},"topic":{"type":"string","enum":["general","news","finance"],"description":"Specifies search category for optimized results.\\n\\nUse \\"general\\" (default) for most queries, INCLUDING those with terms like \\n\\"latest,\\" \\"newest,\\" or \\"recent\\" when referring to general information.\\n\\nUse \\"finance\\" for markets, investments, economic data, or financial news.\\n\\nUse \\"news\\" ONLY for politics, sports, or major current events covered by \\nmainstream media - NOT simply because a query asks for \\"new\\" information."}},"required":["query"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

other

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","description":"Search query to look up"},"includeDomains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"A list of domains to restrict search results to.\\n\\nUse this parameter when:\\n1. The user explicitly requests information from specific websites (e.g., \\"Find climate data from nasa.gov\\")\\n2. The user mentions an organization or company without specifying the domain (e.g., \\"Find information about iPhones from Apple\\")\\n\\nIn both cases, you should determine the appropriate domains (e.g., [\\"nasa.gov\\"] or [\\"apple.com\\"]) and set this parameter.\\n\\nResults will ONLY come from the specified domains - no other sources will be included.\\nDefault is None (no domain restriction)."},"excludeDomains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"A list of domains to exclude from search results.\\n\\nUse this parameter when:\\n1. The user explicitly requests to avoid certain websites (e.g., \\"Find information about climate change but not from twitter.com\\")\\n2. The user mentions not wanting results from specific organizations without naming the domain (e.g., \\"Find phone reviews but nothing from Apple\\")\\n\\nIn both cases, you should determine the appropriate domains to exclude (e.g., [\\"twitter.com\\"] or [\\"apple.com\\"]) and set this parameter.\\n\\nResults will filter out all content from the specified domains.\\nDefault is None (no domain exclusion)."},"searchDepth":{"type":"string","enum":["basic","advanced"],"description":"Controls search thoroughness and result comprehensiveness.\\n\\nUse \\"basic\\" for simple queries requiring quick, straightforward answers.\\n\\nUse \\"advanced\\" (default) for complex queries, specialized topics, \\nrare information, or when in-depth analysis is needed."},"includeImages":{"type":"boolean","description":"Determines if the search returns relevant images along with text results.\\n\\nSet to True when the user explicitly requests visuals or when images would \\nsignificantly enhance understanding (e.g., \\"Show me what black holes look like,\\" \\n\\"Find pictures of Renaissance art\\").\\n\\nLeave as False (default) for most informational queries where text is sufficient."},"timeRange":{"type":"string","enum":["day","week","month","year"],"description":"Limits results to content published within a specific timeframe.\\n\\nONLY set this when the user explicitly mentions a time period \\n(e.g., \\"latest AI news,\\" \\"articles from last week\\").\\n\\nFor less popular or niche topics, use broader time ranges \\n(\\"month\\" or \\"year\\") to ensure sufficient relevant results.\\n\\nOptions: \\"day\\" (24h), \\"week\\" (7d), \\"month\\" (30d), \\"year\\" (365d).\\n\\nDefault is None."},"topic":{"type":"string","enum":["general","news","finance"],"description":"Specifies search category for optimized results.\\n\\nUse \\"general\\" (default) for most queries, INCLUDING those with terms like \\n\\"latest,\\" \\"newest,\\" or \\"recent\\" when referring to general information.\\n\\nUse \\"finance\\" for markets, investments, economic data, or financial news.\\n\\nUse \\"news\\" ONLY for politics, sports, or major current events covered by \\nmainstream media - NOT simply because a query asks for \\"new\\" information."}},"required":["query"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","description":"Search query to look up"},"includeDomains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"A list of domains to restrict search results to.\\n\\nUse this parameter when:\\n1. The user explicitly requests information from specific websites (e.g., \\"Find climate data from nasa.gov\\")\\n2. The user mentions an organization or company without specifying the domain (e.g., \\"Find information about iPhones from Apple\\")\\n\\nIn both cases, you should determine the appropriate domains (e.g., [\\"nasa.gov\\"] or [\\"apple.com\\"]) and set this parameter.\\n\\nResults will ONLY come from the specified domains - no other sources will be included.\\nDefault is None (no domain restriction)."},"excludeDomains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"A list of domains to exclude from search results.\\n\\nUse this parameter when:\\n1. The user explicitly requests to avoid certain websites (e.g., \\"Find information about climate change but not from twitter.com\\")\\n2. The user mentions not wanting results from specific organizations without naming the domain (e.g., \\"Find phone reviews but nothing from Apple\\")\\n\\nIn both cases, you should determine the appropriate domains to exclude (e.g., [\\"twitter.com\\"] or [\\"apple.com\\"]) and set this parameter.\\n\\nResults will filter out all content from the specified domains.\\nDefault is None (no domain exclusion)."},"searchDepth":{"type":"string","enum":["basic","advanced"],"description":"Controls search thoroughness and result comprehensiveness.\\n\\nUse \\"basic\\" for simple queries requiring quick, straightforward answers.\\n\\nUse \\"advanced\\" (default) for complex queries, specialized topics, \\nrare information, or when in-depth analysis is needed."},"includeImages":{"type":"boolean","description":"Determines if the search returns relevant images along with text results.\\n\\nSet to True when the user explicitly requests visuals or when images would \\nsignificantly enhance understanding (e.g., \\"Show me what black holes look like,\\" \\n\\"Find pictures of Renaissance art\\").\\n\\nLeave as False (default) for most informational queries where text is sufficient."},"timeRange":{"type":"string","enum":["day","week","month","year"],"description":"Limits results to content published within a specific timeframe.\\n\\nONLY set this when the user explicitly mentions a time period \\n(e.g., \\"latest AI news,\\" \\"articles from last week\\").\\n\\nFor less popular or niche topics, use broader time ranges \\n(\\"month\\" or \\"year\\") to ensure sufficient relevant results.\\n\\nOptions: \\"day\\" (24h), \\"week\\" (7d), \\"month\\" (30d), \\"year\\" (365d).\\n\\nDefault is None."},"topic":{"type":"string","enum":["general","news","finance"],"description":"Specifies search category for optimized results.\\n\\nUse \\"general\\" (default) for most queries, INCLUDING those with terms like \\n\\"latest,\\" \\"newest,\\" or \\"recent\\" when referring to general information.\\n\\nUse \\"finance\\" for markets, investments, economic data, or financial news.\\n\\nUse \\"news\\" ONLY for politics, sports, or major current events covered by \\nmainstream media - NOT simply because a query asks for \\"new\\" information."}},"required":["query"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

other

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",

Lionel Messi suffered an injury during the game but still celebrated his team's record 16th Copa America title. Colombia had a late penalty appeal denied by VAR, which confirmed Argentina's victory. This marked Argentina's successful defense of their Copa America crown, with goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez playing a crucial role in keeping a clean sheet. The tournament saw Argentina emerge as champions despite not being absolute favorites entering the final.",

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","description":"Search query to look up"},"includeDomains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"A list of domains to restrict search results to.\\n\\nUse this parameter when:\\n1. The user explicitly requests information from specific websites (e.g., \\"Find climate data from nasa.gov\\")\\n2. The user mentions an organization or company without specifying the domain (e.g., \\"Find information about iPhones from Apple\\")\\n\\nIn both cases, you should determine the appropriate domains (e.g., [\\"nasa.gov\\"] or [\\"apple.com\\"]) and set this parameter.\\n\\nResults will ONLY come from the specified domains - no other sources will be included.\\nDefault is None (no domain restriction)."},"excludeDomains":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"A list of domains to exclude from search results.\\n\\nUse this parameter when:\\n1. The user explicitly requests to avoid certain websites (e.g., \\"Find information about climate change but not from twitter.com\\")\\n2. The user mentions not wanting results from specific organizations without naming the domain (e.g., \\"Find phone reviews but nothing from Apple\\")\\n\\nIn both cases, you should determine the appropriate domains to exclude (e.g., [\\"twitter.com\\"] or [\\"apple.com\\"]) and set this parameter.\\n\\nResults will filter out all content from the specified domains.\\nDefault is None (no domain exclusion)."},"searchDepth":{"type":"string","enum":["basic","advanced"],"description":"Controls search thoroughness and result comprehensiveness.\\n\\nUse \\"basic\\" for simple queries requiring quick, straightforward answers.\\n\\nUse \\"advanced\\" (default) for complex queries, specialized topics, \\nrare information, or when in-depth analysis is needed."},"includeImages":{"type":"boolean","description":"Determines if the search returns relevant images along with text results.\\n\\nSet to True when the user explicitly requests visuals or when images would \\nsignificantly enhance understanding (e.g., \\"Show me what black holes look like,\\" \\n\\"Find pictures of Renaissance art\\").\\n\\nLeave as False (default) for most informational queries where text is sufficient."},"timeRange":{"type":"string","enum":["day","week","month","year"],"description":"Limits results to content published within a specific timeframe.\\n\\nONLY set this when the user explicitly mentions a time period \\n(e.g., \\"latest AI news,\\" \\"articles from last week\\").\\n\\nFor less popular or niche topics, use broader time ranges \\n(\\"month\\" or \\"year\\") to ensure sufficient relevant results.\\n\\nOptions: \\"day\\" (24h), \\"week\\" (7d), \\"month\\" (30d), \\"year\\" (365d).\\n\\nDefault is None."},"topic":{"type":"string","enum":["general","news","finance"],"description":"Specifies search category for optimized results.\\n\\nUse \\"general\\" (default) for most queries, INCLUDING those with terms like \\n\\"latest,\\" \\"newest,\\" or \\"recent\\" when referring to general information.\\n\\nUse \\"finance\\" for markets, investments, economic data, or financial news.\\n\\nUse \\"news\\" ONLY for politics, sports, or major current events covered by \\nmainstream media - NOT simply because a query asks for \\"new\\" information."}},"required":["query"],"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",

}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query.

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

In a thrilling conclusion to the 2024 Copa America, Argentina emerged victorious, defeating Colombia 1-0 in a match filled with tension, drama, and late-game heroics. The final, held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, was delayed by over an hour due to overcrowding issues, adding to the anticipation and intensity of the encounter. Lionel Messi, despite suffering an injury during the game, celebrated his team's record 16th Copa America title, cementing Argentina's dominance in South American football.

The decisive moment came in the 88th minute when Lautaro Martínez capitalized on a rebound from a corner kick, slotting home the winning goal. The strike sent Argentine fans into raptures and left Colombia heartbroken. Colombia had a late penalty appeal denied by VAR, a decision that confirmed Argentina's victory and sparked debates among fans and pundits alike. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez played a pivotal role, keeping a clean sheet and making crucial saves to ensure his team's triumph.

Argentina's victory marked a successful defense of their Copa America crown, a testament to their resilience and tactical prowess under pressure. Entering the final, they were not the absolute favorites, but their ability to grind out results when it mattered most proved decisive. The team's collective effort, combined with individual brilliance from players like Lautaro Martínez and Emiliano Martínez, underscored their status as one of the continent's top sides.

As the final whistle blew, the Argentine squad erupted in celebration, with Messi, despite his injury, joining his teammates in lifting the trophy. The win not only solidified Argentina's legacy in the tournament but also set the stage for future challenges, including the 2026 World Cup. For Colombia, the narrow defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, but their performance throughout the tournament earned them respect and admiration. The 2024 Copa America will be remembered for its drama, passion, and the indomitable spirit of the champions, Argentina.",

In a thrilling conclusion to the 2024 Copa America, Argentina emerged victorious, defeating Colombia 1-0 in a match filled with tension, drama, and late-game heroics. The final, held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, was delayed by over an hour due to overcrowding issues, adding to the anticipation and intensity of the encounter. Lionel Messi, despite suffering an injury during the game, celebrated his team's record 16th Copa America title, cementing Argentina's dominance in South American football.

The decisive moment came in the 88th minute when Lautaro Martínez capitalized on a rebound from a corner kick, slotting home the winning goal. The strike sent Argentine fans into raptures and left Colombia heartbroken. Colombia had a late penalty appeal denied by VAR, a decision that confirmed Argentina's victory and sparked debates among fans and pundits alike. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez played a pivotal role, keeping a clean sheet and making crucial saves to ensure his team's triumph.

Argentina's victory marked a successful defense of their Copa America crown, a testament to their resilience and tactical prowess under pressure. Entering the final, they were not the absolute favorites, but their ability to grind out results when it mattered most proved decisive. The team's collective effort, combined with individual brilliance from players like Lautaro Martínez and Emiliano Martínez, underscored their status as one of the continent's top sides.

As the final whistle blew, the Argentine squad erupted in celebration, with Messi, despite his injury, joining his teammates in lifting the trophy. The win not only solidified Argentina's legacy in the tournament but also set the stage for future challenges, including the 2026 World Cup. For Colombia, the narrow defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, but their performance throughout the tournament earned them respect and admiration. The 2024 Copa America will be remembered for its drama, passion, and the indomitable spirit of the champions, Argentina.",

In a thrilling conclusion to the 2024 Copa America, Argentina emerged victorious, defeating Colombia 1-0 in a match filled with tension, drama, and late-game heroics. The final, held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, was delayed by over an hour due to overcrowding issues, adding to the anticipation and intensity of the encounter. Lionel Messi, despite suffering an injury during the game, celebrated his team's record 16th Copa America title, cementing Argentina's dominance in South American football.

The decisive moment came in the 88th minute when Lautaro Martínez capitalized on a rebound from a corner kick, slotting home the winning goal. The strike sent Argentine fans into raptures and left Colombia heartbroken. Colombia had a late penalty appeal denied by VAR, a decision that confirmed Argentina's victory and sparked debates among fans and pundits alike. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez played a pivotal role, keeping a clean sheet and making crucial saves to ensure his team's triumph.

Argentina's victory marked a successful defense of their Copa America crown, a testament to their resilience and tactical prowess under pressure. Entering the final, they were not the absolute favorites, but their ability to grind out results when it mattered most proved decisive. The team's collective effort, combined with individual brilliance from players like Lautaro Martínez and Emiliano Martínez, underscored their status as one of the continent's top sides.

As the final whistle blew, the Argentine squad erupted in celebration, with Messi, despite his injury, joining his teammates in lifting the trophy. The win not only solidified Argentina's legacy in the tournament but also set the stage for future challenges, including the 2026 World Cup. For Colombia, the narrow defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, but their performance throughout the tournament earned them respect and admiration.

The strike sent Argentine fans into raptures and left Colombia heartbroken. Colombia had a late penalty appeal denied by VAR, a decision that confirmed Argentina's victory and sparked debates among fans and pundits alike. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez played a pivotal role, keeping a clean sheet and making crucial saves to ensure his team's triumph.

Argentina's victory marked a successful defense of their Copa America crown, a testament to their resilience and tactical prowess under pressure. Entering the final, they were not the absolute favorites, but their ability to grind out results when it mattered most proved decisive. The team's collective effort, combined with individual brilliance from players like Lautaro Martínez and Emiliano Martínez, underscored their status as one of the continent's top sides.

As the final whistle blew, the Argentine squad erupted in celebration, with Messi, despite his injury, joining his teammates in lifting the trophy. The win not only solidified Argentina's legacy in the tournament but also set the stage for future challenges, including the 2026 World Cup. For Colombia, the narrow defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, but their performance throughout the tournament earned them respect and admiration. The 2024 Copa America will be remembered for its drama, passion, and the indomitable spirit of the champions, Argentina.",

In a thrilling conclusion to the 2024 Copa America, Argentina emerged victorious, defeating Colombia 1-0 in a match filled with tension, drama, and late-game heroics. The final, held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, was delayed by over an hour due to overcrowding issues, adding to the anticipation and intensity of the encounter. Lionel Messi, despite suffering an injury during the game, celebrated his team's record 16th Copa America title, cementing Argentina's dominance in South American football.

The decisive moment came in the 88th minute when Lautaro Martínez capitalized on a rebound from a corner kick, slotting home the winning goal. The strike sent Argentine fans into raptures and left Colombia heartbroken. Colombia had a late penalty appeal denied by VAR, a decision that confirmed Argentina's victory and sparked debates among fans and pundits alike. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez played a pivotal role, keeping a clean sheet and making crucial saves to ensure his team's triumph.

Argentina's victory marked a successful defense of their Copa America crown, a testament to their resilience and tactical prowess under pressure. Entering the final, they were not the absolute favorites, but their ability to grind out results when it mattered most proved decisive. The team's collective effort, combined with individual brilliance from players like Lautaro Martínez and Emiliano Martínez, underscored their status as one of the continent's top sides.

As the final whistle blew, the Argentine squad erupted in celebration, with Messi, despite his injury, joining his teammates in lifting the trophy. The win not only solidified Argentina's legacy in the tournament but also set the stage for future challenges, including the 2026 World Cup. For Colombia, the narrow defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, but their performance throughout the tournament earned them respect and admiration. The 2024 Copa America will be remembered for its drama, passion, and the indomitable spirit of the champions, Argentina.",

In a thrilling conclusion to the 2024 Copa America, Argentina emerged victorious, defeating Colombia 1-0 in a match filled with tension, drama, and late-game heroics. The final, held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, was delayed by over an hour due to overcrowding issues, adding to the anticipation and intensity of the encounter. Lionel Messi, despite suffering an injury during the game, celebrated his team's record 16th Copa America title, cementing Argentina's dominance in South American football.

The decisive moment came in the 88th minute when Lautaro Martínez capitalized on a rebound from a corner kick, slotting home the winning goal. The strike sent Argentine fans into raptures and left Colombia heartbroken. Colombia had a late penalty appeal denied by VAR, a decision that confirmed Argentina's victory and sparked debates among fans and pundits alike. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez played a pivotal role, keeping a clean sheet and making crucial saves to ensure his team's triumph.

Argentina's victory marked a successful defense of their Copa America crown, a testament to their resilience and tactical prowess under pressure. Entering the final, they were not the absolute favorites, but their ability to grind out results when it mattered most proved decisive. The team's collective effort, combined with individual brilliance from players like Lautaro Martínez and Emiliano Martínez, underscored their status as one of the continent's top sides.

As the final whistle blew, the Argentine squad erupted in celebration, with Messi, despite his injury, joining his teammates in lifting the trophy. The win not only solidified Argentina's legacy in the tournament but also set the stage for future challenges, including the 2026 World Cup. For Colombia, the narrow defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, but their performance throughout the tournament earned them respect and admiration.

In a thrilling conclusion to the 2024 Copa America, Argentina emerged victorious, defeating Colombia 1-0 in a match filled with tension, drama, and late-game heroics. The final, held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, was delayed by over an hour due to overcrowding issues, adding to the anticipation and intensity of the encounter. Lionel Messi, despite suffering an injury during the game, celebrated his team's record 16th Copa America title, cementing Argentina's dominance in South American football.

The decisive moment came in the 88th minute when Lautaro Martínez capitalized on a rebound from a corner kick, slotting home the winning goal. The strike sent Argentine fans into raptures and left Colombia heartbroken. Colombia had a late penalty appeal denied by VAR, a decision that confirmed Argentina's victory and sparked debates among fans and pundits alike. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez played a pivotal role, keeping a clean sheet and making crucial saves to ensure his team's triumph.

Argentina's victory marked a successful defense of their Copa America crown, a testament to their resilience and tactical prowess under pressure. Entering the final, they were not the absolute favorites, but their ability to grind out results when it mattered most proved decisive. The team's collective effort, combined with individual brilliance from players like Lautaro Martínez and Emiliano Martínez, underscored their status as one of the continent's top sides.

As the final whistle blew, the Argentine squad erupted in celebration, with Messi, despite his injury, joining his teammates in lifting the trophy. The win not only solidified Argentina's legacy in the tournament but also set the stage for future challenges, including the 2026 World Cup. For Colombia, the narrow defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, but their performance throughout the tournament earned them respect and admiration. The 2024 Copa America will be remembered for its drama, passion, and the indomitable spirit of the champions, Argentina.",

The decisive moment came in the 88th minute when Lautaro Martínez capitalized on a rebound from a corner kick, slotting home the winning goal. The strike sent Argentine fans into raptures and left Colombia heartbroken. Colombia had a late penalty appeal denied by VAR, a decision that confirmed Argentina's victory and sparked debates among fans and pundits alike. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez played a pivotal role, keeping a clean sheet and making crucial saves to ensure his team's triumph.

Argentina's victory marked a successful defense of their Copa America crown, a testament to their resilience and tactical prowess under pressure. Entering the final, they were not the absolute favorites, but their ability to grind out results when it mattered most proved decisive. The team's collective effort, combined with individual brilliance from players like Lautaro Martínez and Emiliano Martínez, underscored their status as one of the continent's top sides.

As the final whistle blew, the Argentine squad erupted in celebration, with Messi, despite his injury, joining his teammates in lifting the trophy. The win not only solidified Argentina's legacy in the tournament but also set the stage for future challenges, including the 2026 World Cup. For Colombia, the narrow defeat was a bitter pill to swallow, but their performance throughout the tournament earned them respect and admiration. The 2024 Copa America will be remembered for its drama, passion, and the indomitable spirit of the champions, Argentina.",

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

other

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

other

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

On July 14, 2024, the grand finale of the Copa América unfolded at the iconic Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, where Argentina triumphed over Colombia with a narrow 1-0 victory, securing their historic 16th title. The match was a test of endurance and skill, highlighted by a tense atmosphere that included an unexpected delay of over an hour before kickoff due to overcrowding. This upheaval, coupled with Argentina's legendary captain Lionel Messi leaving the field early due to an injury, made for a gripping spectacle that kept fans on the edge of their seats.

Argentina, aiming to solidify their position as a dominant force in South American football, entered the match with high expectations. The game proved to be fiercely contested, as Colombia sought to dethrone the defending champions. Both teams exhibited commendable tactics and showcased their talents, but it was Argentina that would eventually snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the dying moments of extra time.

The decisive moment came in the 112th minute when a superb build-up play led to a phenomenal goal, leaving fans erupting in joy. This goal not only sealed the win but also emphasized the sheer determination and skill that has characterized Argentina's journey throughout this tournament. Despite the absence of their star player, Messi, for a significant portion of the match due to injury, Argentina maintained their poise and executed their game plan effectively.

As the final whistle blew, it marked a historic achievement for Argentina, further embedding their legacy in Copa América history. Winning this championship for the 16th time signifies their unmatched pedigree in the tournament and adds to their success story. Fans celebrated in unison, embracing their nation’s ability to triumph against the odds, making this Copa América final a memorable chapter in the annals of Argentine football. The victory reflects Argentina's rich football heritage, reminding the world of the skill, passion, and grit that have defined their national team for generations.",

The game proved to be fiercely contested, as Colombia sought to dethrone the defending champions.

The decisive moment came in the 112th minute when a superb build-up play led to a phenomenal goal, leaving fans erupting in joy. This goal not only sealed the win but also emphasized the sheer determination and skill that has characterized Argentina's journey throughout this tournament. Despite the absence of their star player, Messi, for a significant portion of the match due to injury, Argentina maintained their poise and executed their game plan effectively.

The game proved to be fiercely contested, as Colombia sought to dethrone the defending champions.

The decisive moment came in the 112th minute when a superb build-up play led to a phenomenal goal, leaving fans erupting in joy. This goal not only sealed the win but also emphasized the sheer determination and skill that has characterized Argentina's journey throughout this tournament. Despite the absence of their star player, Messi, for a significant portion of the match due to injury, Argentina maintained their poise and executed their game plan effectively.

Winning this championship for the 16th time signifies their unmatched pedigree in the tournament and adds to their success story.

### Introduction
The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final was a spectacle of global football excellence, culminating in a decisive victory for Chelsea FC over Paris Saint-Germain on July 13, 2025, at the iconic MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This expanded 32-team tournament represented a significant evolution in international club competition, blending elite talent from around the world into a high-stakes showdown. Chelsea's dominant 3-0 win not only highlighted their tactical prowess but also solidified their reputation as one of the premier clubs on the global stage, drawing attention from fans, analysts, and even political figures.

### Body
In a match that showcased Chelsea's superior strategy and execution, manager Enzo Maresca orchestrated a masterful tactical dismantling of Paris Saint-Germain from the opening whistle. The Blues controlled the tempo early, with key midfielder Cole Palmer delivering a masterclass performance that dictated the flow of the game. Palmer's vision and precision in passing were instrumental in breaking down PSG's defense, setting the stage for Chelsea's offensive onslaught. The first goal came midway through the first half, as Joao Pedro capitalized on a well-executed counterattack, firing a clinical shot into the net to give Chelsea a well-deserved lead. This moment not only energized the crowd but also underscored the team's cohesive play, making it clear that PSG was up against a well-oiled machine.

The second half saw Chelsea extend their dominance, with additional goals further exposing PSG's defensive vulnerabilities. Joao Pedro added to his tally with a brilliant finish, celebrating Chelsea's third goal in style and effectively sealing the match. The French side struggled to mount a comeback, hampered by Chelsea's relentless pressure and Maresca's astute substitutions. Beyond the on-field action, the event was elevated by its ceremonial elements, including the trophy presentation involving U.S. President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino. This added a unique political and cultural layer to the proceedings, turning the final into more than just a football match—it became a symbol of global unity and competition.

   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

}

### Observation

{

    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR

   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query.

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

other

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

### Introduction
The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final was a spectacle of global football excellence, culminating in a decisive victory for Chelsea FC over Paris Saint-Germain on July 13, 2025, at the iconic MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This expanded 32-team tournament represented a significant evolution in international club competition, blending elite talent from around the world into a high-stakes showdown. Chelsea's dominant 3-0 win not only highlighted their tactical prowess but also solidified their reputation as one of the premier clubs on the global stage, drawing attention from fans, analysts, and even political figures.

### Body
In a match that showcased Chelsea's superior strategy and execution, manager Enzo Maresca orchestrated a masterful tactical dismantling of Paris Saint-Germain from the opening whistle. The Blues controlled the tempo early, with key midfielder Cole Palmer delivering a masterclass performance that dictated the flow of the game. Palmer's vision and precision in passing were instrumental in breaking down PSG's defense, setting the stage for Chelsea's offensive onslaught. The first goal came midway through the first half, as Joao Pedro capitalized on a well-executed counterattack, firing a clinical shot into the net to give Chelsea a well-deserved lead. This moment not only energized the crowd but also underscored the team's cohesive play, making it clear that PSG was up against a well-oiled machine.

The second half saw Chelsea extend their dominance, with additional goals further exposing PSG's defensive vulnerabilities. Joao Pedro added to his tally with a brilliant finish, celebrating Chelsea's third goal in style and effectively sealing the match. The French side struggled to mount a comeback, hampered by Chelsea's relentless pressure and Maresca's astute substitutions. Beyond the on-field action, the event was elevated by its ceremonial elements, including the trophy presentation involving U.S. President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino. This added a unique political and cultural layer to the proceedings, turning the final into more than just a football match—it became a symbol of global unity and competition.

### Conclusion
Chelsea FC's triumph in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final marks a historic milestone in the tournament's evolution, emphasizing the growing importance of international club football.

### Introduction
The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final was a spectacle of global football excellence, culminating in a decisive victory for Chelsea FC over Paris Saint-Germain on July 13, 2025, at the iconic MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This expanded 32-team tournament represented a significant evolution in international club competition, blending elite talent from around the world into a high-stakes showdown. Chelsea's dominant 3-0 win not only highlighted their tactical prowess but also solidified their reputation as one of the premier clubs on the global stage, drawing attention from fans, analysts, and even political figures.

### Body
In a match that showcased Chelsea's superior strategy and execution, manager Enzo Maresca orchestrated a masterful tactical dismantling of Paris Saint-Germain from the opening whistle. The Blues controlled the tempo early, with key midfielder Cole Palmer delivering a masterclass performance that dictated the flow of the game. Palmer's vision and precision in passing were instrumental in breaking down PSG's defense, setting the stage for Chelsea's offensive onslaught. The first goal came midway through the first half, as Joao Pedro capitalized on a well-executed counterattack, firing a clinical shot into the net to give Chelsea a well-deserved lead. This moment not only energized the crowd but also underscored the team's cohesive play, making it clear that PSG was up against a well-oiled machine.

The second half saw Chelsea extend their dominance, with additional goals further exposing PSG's defensive vulnerabilities. Joao Pedro added to his tally with a brilliant finish, celebrating Chelsea's third goal in style and effectively sealing the match. The French side struggled to mount a comeback, hampered by Chelsea's relentless pressure and Maresca's astute substitutions. Beyond the on-field action, the event was elevated by its ceremonial elements, including the trophy presentation involving U.S. President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino. This added a unique political and cultural layer to the proceedings, turning the final into more than just a football match—it became a symbol of global unity and competition.

### Conclusion
Chelsea FC's triumph in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final marks a historic milestone in the tournament's evolution, emphasizing the growing importance of international club football. With their 3-0 victory, the Blues not only claimed the coveted trophy but also reinforced their status as a dominant force in world football, thanks to standout performances from players like Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro. As the dust settles on this thrilling encounter, Chelsea's success serves as an inspiration for aspiring clubs worldwide, highlighting the rewards of strategic innovation and team synergy.

### Introduction
The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final was a spectacle of global football excellence, culminating in a decisive victory for Chelsea FC over Paris Saint-Germain on July 13, 2025, at the iconic MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This expanded 32-team tournament represented a significant evolution in international club competition, blending elite talent from around the world into a high-stakes showdown. Chelsea's dominant 3-0 win not only highlighted their tactical prowess but also solidified their reputation as one of the premier clubs on the global stage, drawing attention from fans, analysts, and even political figures.

### Body
In a match that showcased Chelsea's superior strategy and execution, manager Enzo Maresca orchestrated a masterful tactical dismantling of Paris Saint-Germain from the opening whistle. The Blues controlled the tempo early, with key midfielder Cole Palmer delivering a masterclass performance that dictated the flow of the game. Palmer's vision and precision in passing were instrumental in breaking down PSG's defense, setting the stage for Chelsea's offensive onslaught. The first goal came midway through the first half, as Joao Pedro capitalized on a well-executed counterattack, firing a clinical shot into the net to give Chelsea a well-deserved lead. This moment not only energized the crowd but also underscored the team's cohesive play, making it clear that PSG was up against a well-oiled machine.

The second half saw Chelsea extend their dominance, with additional goals further exposing PSG's defensive vulnerabilities. Joao Pedro added to his tally with a brilliant finish, celebrating Chelsea's third goal in style and effectively sealing the match. The French side struggled to mount a comeback, hampered by Chelsea's relentless pressure and Maresca's astute substitutions. Beyond the on-field action, the event was elevated by its ceremonial elements, including the trophy presentation involving U.S. President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino. This added a unique political and cultural layer to the proceedings, turning the final into more than just a football match—it became a symbol of global unity and competition.

### Conclusion
Chelsea FC's triumph in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final marks a historic milestone in the tournament's evolution, emphasizing the growing importance of international club football. With their 3-0 victory, the Blues not only claimed the coveted trophy but also reinforced their status as a dominant force in world football, thanks to standout performances from players like Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro. As the dust settles on this thrilling encounter, Chelsea's success serves as an inspiration for aspiring clubs worldwide, highlighting the rewards of strategic innovation and team synergy. This event will undoubtedly be remembered as a pivotal chapter in football history, blending athletic excellence with memorable global moments.",

### Introduction
The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final was a spectacle of global football excellence, culminating in a decisive victory for Chelsea FC over Paris Saint-Germain on July 13, 2025, at the iconic MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This expanded 32-team tournament represented a significant evolution in international club competition, blending elite talent from around the world into a high-stakes showdown. Chelsea's dominant 3-0 win not only highlighted their tactical prowess but also solidified their reputation as one of the premier clubs on the global stage, drawing attention from fans, analysts, and even political figures.

### Body
In a match that showcased Chelsea's superior strategy and execution, manager Enzo Maresca orchestrated a masterful tactical dismantling of Paris Saint-Germain from the opening whistle. The Blues controlled the tempo early, with key midfielder Cole Palmer delivering a masterclass performance that dictated the flow of the game. Palmer's vision and precision in passing were instrumental in breaking down PSG's defense, setting the stage for Chelsea's offensive onslaught. The first goal came midway through the first half, as Joao Pedro capitalized on a well-executed counterattack, firing a clinical shot into the net to give Chelsea a well-deserved lead. This moment not only energized the crowd but also underscored the team's cohesive play, making it clear that PSG was up against a well-oiled machine.

The second half saw Chelsea extend their dominance, with additional goals further exposing PSG's defensive vulnerabilities. Joao Pedro added to his tally with a brilliant finish, celebrating Chelsea's third goal in style and effectively sealing the match. The French side struggled to mount a comeback, hampered by Chelsea's relentless pressure and Maresca's astute substitutions. Beyond the on-field action, the event was elevated by its ceremonial elements, including the trophy presentation involving U.S. President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino. This added a unique political and cultural layer to the proceedings, turning the final into more than just a football match—it became a symbol of global unity and competition.

### Conclusion
Chelsea FC's triumph in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final marks a historic milestone in the tournament's evolution, emphasizing the growing importance of international club football. With their 3-0 victory, the Blues not only claimed the coveted trophy but also reinforced their status as a dominant force in world football, thanks to standout performances from players like Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro. As the dust settles on this thrilling encounter, Chelsea's success serves as an inspiration for aspiring clubs worldwide, highlighting the rewards of strategic innovation and team synergy.

### Introduction
The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final was a spectacle of global football excellence, culminating in a decisive victory for Chelsea FC over Paris Saint-Germain on July 13, 2025, at the iconic MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This expanded 32-team tournament represented a significant evolution in international club competition, blending elite talent from around the world into a high-stakes showdown. Chelsea's dominant 3-0 win not only highlighted their tactical prowess but also solidified their reputation as one of the premier clubs on the global stage, drawing attention from fans, analysts, and even political figures.

### Body
In a match that showcased Chelsea's superior strategy and execution, manager Enzo Maresca orchestrated a masterful tactical dismantling of Paris Saint-Germain from the opening whistle. The Blues controlled the tempo early, with key midfielder Cole Palmer delivering a masterclass performance that dictated the flow of the game. Palmer's vision and precision in passing were instrumental in breaking down PSG's defense, setting the stage for Chelsea's offensive onslaught. The first goal came midway through the first half, as Joao Pedro capitalized on a well-executed counterattack, firing a clinical shot into the net to give Chelsea a well-deserved lead. This moment not only energized the crowd but also underscored the team's cohesive play, making it clear that PSG was up against a well-oiled machine.

The second half saw Chelsea extend their dominance, with additional goals further exposing PSG's defensive vulnerabilities. Joao Pedro added to his tally with a brilliant finish, celebrating Chelsea's third goal in style and effectively sealing the match. The French side struggled to mount a comeback, hampered by Chelsea's relentless pressure and Maresca's astute substitutions. Beyond the on-field action, the event was elevated by its ceremonial elements, including the trophy presentation involving U.S. President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino. This added a unique political and cultural layer to the proceedings, turning the final into more than just a football match—it became a symbol of global unity and competition.

Chelsea FC's triumph in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final marks a historic milestone in the tournament's evolution, emphasizing the growing importance of international club football.

### Introduction
The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final was a spectacle of global football excellence, culminating in a decisive victory for Chelsea FC over Paris Saint-Germain on July 13, 2025, at the iconic MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This expanded 32-team tournament represented a significant evolution in international club competition, blending elite talent from around the world into a high-stakes showdown. Chelsea's dominant 3-0 win not only highlighted their tactical prowess but also solidified their reputation as one of the premier clubs on the global stage, drawing attention from fans, analysts, and even political figures.

### Body
In a match that showcased Chelsea's superior strategy and execution, manager Enzo Maresca orchestrated a masterful tactical dismantling of Paris Saint-Germain from the opening whistle. The Blues controlled the tempo early, with key midfielder Cole Palmer delivering a masterclass performance that dictated the flow of the game. Palmer's vision and precision in passing were instrumental in breaking down PSG's defense, setting the stage for Chelsea's offensive onslaught. The first goal came midway through the first half, as Joao Pedro capitalized on a well-executed counterattack, firing a clinical shot into the net to give Chelsea a well-deserved lead. This moment not only energized the crowd but also underscored the team's cohesive play, making it clear that PSG was up against a well-oiled machine.

The second half saw Chelsea extend their dominance, with additional goals further exposing PSG's defensive vulnerabilities. Joao Pedro added to his tally with a brilliant finish, celebrating Chelsea's third goal in style and effectively sealing the match. The French side struggled to mount a comeback, hampered by Chelsea's relentless pressure and Maresca's astute substitutions. Beyond the on-field action, the event was elevated by its ceremonial elements, including the trophy presentation involving U.S. President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino. This added a unique political and cultural layer to the proceedings, turning the final into more than just a football match—it became a symbol of global unity and competition.

### Conclusion
Chelsea FC's triumph in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final marks a historic milestone in the tournament's evolution, emphasizing the growing importance of international club football. With their 3-0 victory, the Blues not only claimed the coveted trophy but also reinforced their status as a dominant force in world football, thanks to standout performances from players like Cole Palmer and Joao Pedro. As the dust settles on this thrilling encounter, Chelsea's success serves as an inspiration for aspiring clubs worldwide, highlighting the rewards of strategic innovation and team synergy.

### Introduction
The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final was a spectacle of global football excellence, culminating in a decisive victory for Chelsea FC over Paris Saint-Germain on July 13, 2025, at the iconic MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. This expanded 32-team tournament represented a significant evolution in international club competition, blending elite talent from around the world into a high-stakes showdown. Chelsea's dominant 3-0 win not only highlighted their tactical prowess but also solidified their reputation as one of the premier clubs on the global stage, drawing attention from fans, analysts, and even political figures.

### Body
In a match that showcased Chelsea's superior strategy and execution, manager Enzo Maresca orchestrated a masterful tactical dismantling of Paris Saint-Germain from the opening whistle. The Blues controlled the tempo early, with key midfielder Cole Palmer delivering a masterclass performance that dictated the flow of the game. Palmer's vision and precision in passing were instrumental in breaking down PSG's defense, setting the stage for Chelsea's offensive onslaught. The first goal came midway through the first half, as Joao Pedro capitalized on a well-executed counterattack, firing a clinical shot into the net to give Chelsea a well-deserved lead. This moment not only energized the crowd but also underscored the team's cohesive play, making it clear that PSG was up against a well-oiled machine.

The second half saw Chelsea extend their dominance, with additional goals further exposing PSG's defensive vulnerabilities. Joao Pedro added to his tally with a brilliant finish, celebrating Chelsea's third goal in style and effectively sealing the match. The French side struggled to mount a comeback, hampered by Chelsea's relentless pressure and Maresca's astute substitutions. Beyond the on-field action, the event was elevated by its ceremonial elements, including the trophy presentation involving U.S. President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino. This added a unique political and cultural layer to the proceedings, turning the final into more than just a football match—it became a symbol of global unity and competition.
