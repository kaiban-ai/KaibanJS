The current year is 2023, so 2025 is in the future. Sports events like this haven't occurred yet.\n\nMy role is to find up-to-date information. If the event hasn't happened, I can't find real information about it. I should use the tavily_search tool to check for any announcements or scheduled events, but it's unlikely to have results for a future event.\n\nThe tool description: tavily_search is for current events. For something in 2025, it might not return useful results. I need to handle this carefully.\n\nThe human's message: \"Who won the FIFA Club World Cup final in 2025?\" This implies it's in the future. I should confirm if such an event exists or if it's scheduled.\n\nIn my output, I have to follow the format: Thought + (Action or Self Question), Observation, or Final Answer.\n\nSince I don't have immediate information, I should start with a Thought and an Action. The best action is to use tavily_search to query about it.\n\nFor the search query, I need to form it properly. Something like \"FIFA Club World Cup 2025 winner\" or \"FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final results\". But since it's future, it might not exist.\n\nParameters for tavily_search:\n\n- query: \"FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final\"\n\n- Is there a specific domain? Not mentioned.\n\n- Exclude domains? No.\n\n- Search depth: This is a specific event, but since it's future, \"advanced\" might be better to dig deeper for any announcements.\n\n- Include images: No, this is about information, not visuals.\n\n- Time range: The user is asking about 2025, which is future, so I shouldn't set a time range as it's not for past events. The parameter is for limiting to recent content, but for future events, it might not apply.\n\n- Topic: This is sports, which falls under \"news\" as per the description: \"Use 'news' ONLY for politics, sports, or major current events\".\n\nThe tool says: \"Use 'news' ONLY for politics, sports, or major current events covered by mainstream media\". So, yes, for sports, I should use \"news\".\n\nMy first step is to perform a search.\n\nThought: I need to search for information about the FIFA Club World Cup in 2025.\n\nAction: tavily_search\n\nActionInput: {\n  \"query\": \"FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final winner\",\n  \"topic\": \"news\"\n}\n\nAfter I get the observation, I can decide if I have enough for a Final Answer.\n\nIf the search returns no results, I might need to conclude that the event hasn't happened yet.\n\nFinally, the Final Answer format: \"Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other useful information.\" But if it hasn't happened, I can't provide that.\n\nI should proceed step by step as per the system prompt.",

Now, I'm receiving the observation from that action.\n\nLooking at the search results:\n\n- The results mention a FIFA Club World Cup in 2025, with references to Chelsea winning against Paris Saint-Germain.\n\n- Specific details: It talks about Chelsea FC winning the final on July 13, 2025, at MetLife Stadium. Key players like Reece James, Robert Sanchez, Cole Palmer, and Joao Pedro are mentioned.\n\n- Final score: From the content, it seems Chelsea won 3-0 against Paris Saint-Germain (based on \"Chelsea 3–0 PSG\" in one of the results).\n\n- Key moments: Chelsea's victory, Cole Palmer's masterclass, Joao Pedro's goal, celebrations with the trophy, and involvement of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThis appears to be fictional or simulated data since we're in 2023, and 2025 hasn't happened yet. But I have to work with the provided results.\n\nAs per my role, I need to gather this information and prepare a Final Answer with detailed information: key players, key moments, final score, and other useful information.\n\nThe format requires:\n\n- If I have enough to answer, I should output a Final Answer.\n\n- The Final Answer should be in this structure: {\"finalAnswer\": \"Detailed information about the sports event...\"}\n\nFrom the results:\n\n- Winner: Chelsea FC\n\n- Opponent: Paris Saint-Germain\n\n- Score: 3-0\n\n- Key players: Cole Palmer (masterclass), Joao Pedro (scored), Reece James (celebrated with trophy)\n\n- Key moments: Chelsea's dismantling of PSG, trophy presentation involving Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino.\n\n- Other info: The event was at MetLife Stadium, expanded to 32 teams.\n\nI think I have sufficient information to compile a Final Answer.\n\nIn my previous response, I used \"tavily_search\", and now this is the observation. So, my next output should be either another Thought + Action, Observation, or Final Answer.\n\nThe instruction says:\n\n- Observation: Reflect about the result and say if the Final Answer is ready.\n\n- But in the format, after an action, I get an observation, and then I decide.\n\nIn this case, the human is providing the tool result as an observation. So, I need to process it.\n\nThe message starts with: \"You got this result from the tool: {...}\"\n\nSo, this is simulating the observation.\n\nIn my response, I should now provide an Observation or directly the Final Answer if ready.\n\nFrom the format:\n\n- After an action, the next step is Observation, where I reflect and say if isFinalAnswerReady is true or false.\n\nThen, if true, I can give the Final Answer.\n\nIn the initial setup: \"Observation\" has \"isFinalAnswerReady\": false // or true\n\nSo, perhaps I should first output an Observation with isFinalAnswerReady: true, and then in the next step, output the Final Answer. But the example doesn't specify that; it seems I can go straight to Final Answer if I have it.\n\nLooking back: The system prompt says: You will return just one of the following: Thought + (Action or Self Question) OR Observation OR Final Answer\n\nAnd in Observation, it includes \"isFinalAnswerReady\": false\n\nBut in the flow, after Observation, I might output Final Answer.\n\nTo be precise, I think I can output Final Answer directly if I have the info.\n\nIn the prompt: \"If you have the final answer or not\" in Observation.\n\nPerhaps the safest is to output an Observation first, confirming I have the info, and set isFinalAnswerReady to true, but since the very next message could be Final Answer, and the prompt allows it, I can just go to Final Answer.\n\nThe prompt says: \"You will return just one of the following\", so for this response, I need to choose one.\n\nI think based on the results, I can directly give the Final Answer.\n\nCompile the Final Answer:\n\n- Detailed information: The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final was won by Chelsea FC against Paris Saint-Germain with a final score of 3-0.\n\n- Key players: Cole Palmer, who produced a masterclass; Joao Pedro, who scored; Reece James, who lifted the trophy.\n\n- Key moments: Chelsea's dominant performance, goals leading to 3-0 victory, trophy presentation with Donald Trump and Gianni Infantino present.\n\n- Other useful information: The event took place on July 13, 2025, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It was an expanded tournament with 32 teams.\n\nMake sure it's in the exact format: {\"finalAnswer\": \"The final answer to the Task.\"}\n\nSo, I'll structure it accordingly.",
