Use engaging visuals and videos to increase reach.\n   - **Engagement**: Use polls, quizzes, and contests to create interaction, especially in the month leading up to the event.\n\n2. **Email Campaigns**:  \n   - **Timeline**: \n     - Initial engagement email to announce the event: January 2024  \n     - Follow-up emails: Every two weeks until mid-March, then weekly leading up to the event.  \n   - **Content**: Include event details, registration links, RSVP requests, and reminders about potential project deadlines for companies to facilitate participation.\n   - **Call to Action**: Encourage early registration with limited-time offers or discounts.\n\n3. **Public Relations (PR) Strategy**:  \n   - **Press Release**: Distribute a press release to local media and industry-specific publications in late February 2024 about the event's highlights.\n   - **Media invites**: Send out invitations to local influencers and industry leaders by mid-March to cover the event.\n   - **Follow-ups**: Ensure proactive follow-ups with press contacts to secure coverage and interviews leading up to the event.\n\n**Additional Notes**:  \n- As the event date approaches (mid-April), it’s vital to confirm participation with key stakeholders due to potential project deadlines in companies. \n- Monitor engagement metrics to optimize ongoing marketing strategies and adjust the approach as needed toward the event date. \n- After-event content: Capture and share highlights and participant feedback to maintain engagement for future events.\n\""
